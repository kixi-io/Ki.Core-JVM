# Ki.Core-JVM

This is a [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) implementation of the
Ki.Core library. It is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with annotations that
allow it to be used equally well with 
[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and other
[JVM languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages) such as Scala, Jython
and JRuby. Ki.Core is used common library for Ki projects including the declarative
language [KD](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD)).
